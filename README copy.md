# 23 MERN Stack Application

Projects have played a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you apply for development jobs, your portfolio is absolutely vital to opening doors to opportunities. Your portfolio showcases high-quality deployed examples of your work, and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

This project is a fantastic opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, especially in the context of a scalable, user-focused MERN app. Remember that employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job.

The homepage prominently displays the upcoming events.

Each event listing includes essential details like date, time, location, and a brief description.

Clicking on an event takes the user to a dedicated event page.

On the event page, there's a clear "Register" button.

Clicking the "Register" button opens a simple form asking for basic details (name, email, and contact number).

After filling in the details and submitting the form, the user receives a confirmation message.

The user's provided information is stored securely for event communication purposes.

An email is sent to the user confirming their registration and providing event-specific information.
